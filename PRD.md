# The Prompt Battle: Comprehensive Application Specification

This document outlines the complete specifications for "The Prompt Battle" - a web application for hosting and participating in Generative AI Image Prompt Battles using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Firebase Realtime Database.

## What is a Prompt Battle?

A Prompt Battle is a live competitive event where participants compete against each other using text-to-image AI software. Contestants create text prompts that generate images using AI models like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, or Midjourney. The audience or a panel of judges then selects winners based on who created the most surprising, beautiful, or creative AI-generated images[1][3].

Originally developed by Florian A. Schmidt and Sebastian Schmieg with design students from HTW Dresden in 2022[1][14], Prompt Battles have evolved into various formats and are held at universities, art institutions, and tech events worldwide[15][20].

## Project Overview

The Prompt Battle application is a web-based platform that facilitates real-time prompt battles accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers. The application allows users to either host a battle or join existing battles as contestants or spectators. Hosts configure battle settings and coordinate the event, contestants submit prompts for image generation, and spectators vote for their favorite generated images.

The application will leverage OpenAI's GPT to generate topics for each round and use the host's OpenAI API key to generate images from contestant prompts. The entire platform will operate in real-time using Firebase Realtime Database, providing instant updates to all participants.

## User Roles and Permissions

### Host
- Creates and configures battle settings
- Provides their own OpenAI API key
- Starts/ends rounds and manages the flow of the event
- Can manually override voting results
- Has access to all administrative functions
- Can disable spectator voting for physical events

### Contestant
- Joins existing battles using a battle code
- Creates and submits prompts based on given topics
- Views all generated images
- May participate in voting (if enabled by host)

### Spectator
- Joins existing battles using a battle code
- Views all generated images and prompts
- Votes for favorite images (if enabled)
- Cannot submit prompts

## User Interface Requirements

### Landing Page
- Clear options to create or join a battle
- Information about what a Prompt Battle is
- Responsive design for all devices
- Simple authentication with display name entry

### Host Interface

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- Host's OpenAI API key should never be exposed to clients
- Server-side processing of API requests
- Rate limiting to prevent excessive usage

### Data Validation
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Sanitize prompts for inappropriate content
- Check image content for policy violations

### Access Control
- Implement Firebase Security Rules to restrict access
- Prevent unauthorized access to battles
- Enforce role-based permissions

## Open Source License Recommendation

Based on the requirements and the nature of the application, the MIT License is recommended for this project[8][9]. The MIT License:

- Is short and permissive, allowing users to do almost anything with the code
- Requires only attribution to original authors
- Is widely used in the React ecosystem
- Allows for maximum adoption and collaboration
- Permits both open-source and commercial use of the software

This license aligns well with the collaborative and creative nature of prompt battles while providing basic protections for the original authors[8].

## Implementation Guidelines for AI Development

For optimal AI-assisted development in Cursor with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, we recommend:

### Code Organization
- Organize the project into feature-based modules
- Separate UI components from business logic
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implement custom hooks for Firebase and OpenAI integration

### Database Optimization
- Don't listen at the database root level[7]
- Use query-based rules to limit downloads[7]
- Structure data in a flat, efficient manner[7]
- Optimize connections for better performance[7]

### State Management
- Implement React Context for global state
- Use reducers for complex state transitions
- Consider Firebase's real-time nature in state design
- Cache results where appropriate

### Responsive Design
- Implement a mobile-first approach
- Use CSS modules or styled components
- Define breakpoints for different device sizes
- Ensure touch-friendly UI elements
